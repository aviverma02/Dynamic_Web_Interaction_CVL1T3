# Dynamic_Web_Interaction_C1L1T3
Interactive UI elements built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — including dropdown menus, modal dialogs, and form validation.  
Dynamic Web Interactions with JavaScript

A collection of interactive UI components built using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, demonstrating how to add dynamic behavior to modern web pages. 

🚀 Project Overview

This project showcases three essential interactive elements used in front-end development: 

1. Interactive Dropdown Menu

A dynamic dropdown navigation menu that uses JavaScript to toggle visibility and update navigation output. 

2. Modal Dialog Box

A clean and responsive modal window triggered using JavaScript event listeners and DOM manipulation.  

3. Form with Validation

A functional form that validates user input in real time, ensuring required fields are filled and formats are correct.

These components are designed to improve user experience and help beginners understand how JavaScript interacts with the DOM.
